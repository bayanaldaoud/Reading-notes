The HTML `<a>` tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:
> `<a href="url">link text</a>`

The most important attribute of the `<a>` element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.

Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address.

There are tons of different layout designs to choose from.

##  <span style="color:peru">Functions, Methods, and Objects</span>
  Browsers require very detailed instructions about what
we want them to do. Therefore, complex scripts can run
to hundreds (even thousands) of lines. Programmers use
functions, methods, and objects to organize their code.


1- **Functions** let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).

2- **Objects** group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names.

3- JavaScript **methods** are actions that can be performed on objects.a javaScript method is a property containing a function definition.
