Web technologies change quickly. Here you
can see some of the changes in how animation,
video, and audio are created on the web.

Images can improve the design and the appearance of a web page.

The HTML `<img>` tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The `<img>` tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The `<img> `tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

The `<img>` tag has two required attributes:

* src - Specifies the path to the image
* alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image

```
<img src="url" alt="alternatetext">
```

### Image Size - Width and Height
You can use the style attribute to specify the `width `and` height` of an image.
```
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600">
```

## HTML video and audio
The `<video>` and `<audio>` elements allow us to embed video and audio into web pages. As we showed in Video and audio content.
Each `<button>` has a class name, a data-icon attribute for defining what icon should be shown on each button (we'll show how this works in the below section), and an aria-label attribute to provide an understandable description of each button, since we're not providing a human-readable label inside the tags. The contents of aria-label attributes are read out by screenreaders when their users focus on the elements that contain them.

Search engine optimization helps visitors find your
sites when using search engines.
 Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to
see how many people visit your site, how they find it,
and what they do when they get there.
 To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a
domain name and web hosting.
 FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your
local computer to your web server.
 Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email
newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website
tools (to save you writing them from scratch).
