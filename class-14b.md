It can take some time for a team to develop, a process which formed the focus of Bruce Tuckman’s research which started in the 1960s. Tuckman’s article ‘Developmental Sequence in Small Groups’ 1965, expanded following further research in 1977, concluded that teams typically go through 5 key stages as they form and develop: forming, storming, norming, performing and adjourning.
FORMING:
Sounding anxious and hesitant, feeling out other team members, getting acquainted, learning roles and responsibilites, understanding team goals, looking to team leader for direction.

## STORMING:
Effectiveness reduces, disagreements about role and goals, struggling to establish place in group, forming cliques. Team leader required to facilitate conversations and judging level of communication can be tricky.

## NORMING:
Beginning to work more effectively, respecting each other’s opinions and differences, agreeing on team rules, trusting and helping each other, making progess on the project, not relying on team leader as much.

## PERFORMING:
The team is performing at a high level, making decisions and solving problems quickly and effectively, working independently. Light touch management.

## ADJOURNING:
Team members have bonded and are now likely to move in different directions as the project comes to an end. Feelings may be of sadness and uncertainty about what next. Focused, purposeful and conclusive. Celebration for team’s successes and lessons learned.
