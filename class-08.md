### Building Blocks 
 CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

## Containing Elements
If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.


CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control
the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute
positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position
property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.
* ## Normal flow
is the way that Block and Inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout.

* ## Relative Positioning
Relative positioning moves an
element in relation to where it
would have been in normal flow.

* ## Absolute positioning
When the position property
is given a value of absolute,
the box is taken out of normal
flow and no longer affects the
position of other elements on
the page.
* ## Fixed Positioning
Fixed positioning is a type
of absolute positioning that
requires the position property
to have a value of fixed.

* ## Floating Elements
The float property allows you
to take an element in normal
flow and place it as far to the
left or right of the containing
element as possible.

# Screen Sizes &  Resolution

Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show
different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to
work on a range of different sized screens.
Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some
devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most
operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

## Page Sizes
Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web
designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide
(since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).

## Liquid Layouts
Liquid layout designs
stretch and contract
as the user increases
or decreases the
size of their browser
window. They tend to
use percentages.

## Layout Grids


Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography)
is the placement or arrangement of visual elements.
Grids help create professional and flexible designs
You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
