There are three t XX ypes of HTML lists: ordered,
unordered, and definition.
 
+ ordered 
  * An ordered list created using the `<ol>` element, and each list item starts with the `<li>` element. Ordered lists are used when the order of the list's items is important.
+ unordered
  * An unordered list created using the` <ul> `element, and each list item starts with the `<li>` element.The list items in unordered lists are marked with bullets. 


+ definition
  * The definition list is created using `<dl>` element. The`<dl>` element is used in conjunction with the`<dt>` element which specify a term, and the `<dd>` element which specify the term's definition.

 Sometimes you will want to use
a double or single quote mark
within a string.
You can  use a technique
called escaping the quotation
characters. This is done by
using a backwards slash (or
"backslash") before any type of
quote mark that appears within
a string.

A Boolean variable can only have
a va lue of true or false, but this
data type is very helpful.

Programmers sometimes use
shorthand to create variables.
Here are three variations of how
to declare variables and assign
them values:
1. Variables are declared and
values assigned in the same
statement.
2. Three variables are declared
on the same line, then values
assigned to each.
3. Two variables are declared
and assigned values on the same
line. Then one is declared and
assigned a value on the next line

*  If statements ==> If a condition is true, then run the code in that block.


* For loops ==> Run the code in this block based on a set number of iteration. This is known.
* While loops ==> Run the code in this block while a condition is true. The number of iterations is unknown.
