# <span style="color:black">Design web Pages with CSS</span>
 
## <span style ="color:purple">  CSS </span>
 CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets with an emphasis placed on “Style.” While HTML is used to structure a web document (defining things like headlines and paragraphs, and allowing you to embed images, video, and other media), CSS comes through and specifies your document’s style—page layouts, colors, and fonts are all determined with CSS. Think of HTML as the foundation, and CSS as the aesthetic choices .

## <span style ="color:purple"> What CSS dose?</span>
CSS brings style to your web pages by interacting with HTML elements. Elements are the individual HTML components of a web page—for instance a paragraph—which in HTML might look like this:

`<p>This is my paragraph!</p>`
If you wanted to make this paragraph appear pink and bold to people viewing your web page through a web browser, you’d use CSS code that looks like this:

`p  {  color:pink;  font-weight:bold;  }`

## <span style ="color:purple"> Colors</span>
* ###  <span style ="color:purple"> RGB Color Values</span>
Most of you have probably heard about CMYK values for print design. RGB, which stands for red, green, and blue is the color model that monitors use. Since in web design we're primarily concerned with what web pages look like on screens, RGB is the color model we use.
RGB colors have three values that represent: red, green, and blue.

* ###  <span style ="color:purple"> HSL</span>

The HSL color model is one of the least used, but gaining traction because can be more intuitive to use when working with shades and color adjustments.

HSL stands for: hue, saturation, and lightness

* ###  <span style ="color:purple"> Hexadecimal Color Values</span>



Probably the most common (yet least intuitive) way to specify colors in CSS is to use their hexadecimal (or hex) values. Hex values are actually just a different way to represent RGB values. Instead of using three numbers between 0 and 255, you use six hexadecimal numbers. Hex numbers can be 0-9 and A-F. Hex values are always prefixed with a # symbol.
